#ADXL345_server and ADXL345_client

These two programs "fuse" different open source samples to create a UDP-based server that broadcasts ADXL345 accelerometer data (X,Y,Z,pitch and roll) to a UDP client.
The goal is to support testing with the [Labview UDP VI](http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361M-01/lvcomm/udp_vi_descriptions/) on a closed network (i.e., it's not secure).

The server was developed and tested using a Beaglebone Green board with a [Grove 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer](http://tinyurl.com/pz7tqnp)
The client was developed and tested on Ubuntu 14.04.

To-dos:

1. Port to NVIDIA Tegra TK1
2. Add command-line options (-p for port, -h for help, -l for logging)
3. Modify to use coordinates from an OpenCV image detection routine (to support automated tracking)
4. Add UDP client timeout
